                So far the college life has been pretty cool. I've met a lot of cool people and learned a lot of cool stuff. I even joined this cool 
                club called Hack4Impact which is pretty cool. Even the weather is cool. Well, not in a literal sense but the weather is nice which 
                is cool. Overall I'd give it a cool out of 10.
